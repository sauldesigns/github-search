Github Search is a cross-platform mobile application powered by Flutter Framework and Github API.

The application was built with simplicity in mind so that users are able to search github users and bookmark their profile/repos for quick and easy access.  

The app uses an easy to use UI so that only prompts the user to enter a username, or simply click on a bookmarked user/repo.
